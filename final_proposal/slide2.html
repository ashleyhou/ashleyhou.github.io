		<p>Poem Visualization</p>

	<div class="text">
		<p>"Your Faithful Servant" by S. Bear Bergman is one of my favorite poems. I plan to create a visualization for it, some through Javascript animations, others hand drawn. The poem is about a guardian figure and their unconditional love for the reader. Because of this, I don't plan on making the website very interactive as Bergman emphasizes the passivity of the reader.</p>
